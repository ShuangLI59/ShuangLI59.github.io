Complete your IDP Your initial Individual Development Plan (IDP) meeting helps you set expectations with your faculty sponsor (mentor). Your initial IDP must be completed within three months of your start date.


As noted in my email, you may want to add more throughout this section as you discuss your research activities and proposed methodology and how the requested infrastructure is essential for these aims.

Per the RSO tip sheet:
“Describe a specific and detailed research or technology development program, including research strategies, key activities, methodological approaches, and procedures for data collection and analysis.”

Traditional methods often demand substantial computational resources and prolonged training times, limiting their scalability and practical application. In contrast, we are the first to apply the tri-plane representation specifically for video generation in robot control, making the process not only more efficient but also more feasible for real-world deployment.

For example, in manufacturing, advanced robotic systems can reduce production downtime by up to 40%, translating into significant cost savings for companies. It is estimated that adopting robotics could save Canadian companies millions annually(Statistics Canada https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/22-20-0001/222000012024004-eng.htm). Additionally, a report from the Canadian Robotics Council revealed that companies that adopt robotics technologies experienced a 20% increase in job creation, demonstrating that automation does not reduce employment but instead drives job growth (UofT GovRel). Furthermore, wages in advanced manufacturing sectors that integrate robotics are 50% higher than the national average, showcasing the economic benefits of robotics​(

). Robots with enhanced capabilities, such as those assisting with daily tasks like cleaning, are expected to create new opportunities for startups focusing on AI-driven automation, fostering further job creation and wealth generation in the Canadian economy​(
